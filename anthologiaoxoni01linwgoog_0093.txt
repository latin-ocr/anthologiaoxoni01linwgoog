witae ta houthalen.

To fair Fidele’s grassy tomb
Soft maids and village hinds shall bring
anh opening sweet of earliest bloom‚
And rifle all the breathing spring.

No wailing ghost shall dare appear,
To vex vvith shrieks this quiet grove ;
But shepherd lads assemble here,

And melting virgins own their love.

No withered vvitoh shall here be seen,
No goblins lead their midnight erevv:
The female Fays shall haunt the green,

And dress thy grave with pearly dew.

The red-breast oft at evening hours
Shall kindly lend his little aid,

¹ With hoary moss and gathered flowers >

To deok the ground where thou art laid.
