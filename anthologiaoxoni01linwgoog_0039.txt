She, with all a monarch’s pride,
Felt them in her bosom glow3
Rushed to battle, fought, and died3
Dying hurled them at her foe.

“ Ruffians‚ pitiless as proud,

Heaven awards the vengeance due3

Empire is on us bestowed,

Shame and ruin wait on you.'’
Cowper.

ΕἘΝ such is Time, which takes in trust
Our youth, our joyS, and all we have,

And pays us nought but age and dust,
Which in the dark and silent grave,

When we have wandered all our wayS,
Shuts up the fable of our (lays3 .

And from which earth, and grave, and dust,
The Lonl will raise me up I trust.
