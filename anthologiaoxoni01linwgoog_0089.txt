Το some enchanted castle is eonveyed,
Where gates impregnable‚ and coereive chains,

In durance striot ‹letain him=3 'till‚ inform

Of money, Pallas sets the captive free.

θῦε lsstthttast.

THE Redbreast, sacred to the household gods,
Wisely regardful of the embroiling sky,

⁴ In joyless fields and thorny thiekets leaves

His shivering mateS, and pays t0 trusted man
His annual visit. Half-afraid, he first
Against the window beats; then, brisk, alights

On the warm hearth3 then, hopping 0’er the floor,

Eyes all the smiling family askanee‚
And peeks‚ and starts, and wonders where he is;
T ill, more familiar grown, the table crumbs

Att'ract his slender feet.
Taomson.
