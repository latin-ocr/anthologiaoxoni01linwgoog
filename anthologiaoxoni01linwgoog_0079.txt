Iplucked, the garden’s pride,
Within.the petala of a rose
A sleeping Love I apied.

And placed him, caged within the flower,
On spetless Sarah's breast.

But when, unweeting of the guile,
Awoke the prisoner! sweet,

He struggled to escape awhile,
And stamped his fairy feet.

Then olapped his wings for joy.
