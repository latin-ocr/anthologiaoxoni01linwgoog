ΕΡΜοηΝΗ τὸν ἰατρὸν ἰδὼν Διόφαντος ἐν ὕπνοις,

Οὐκ ἔτ’ ἀνηγέρθη καὶ περίαμμα φέρων.

XXX.

flutipbnluz quuitur.

THERE ’s not a man I meet, but doth salute me
As if I were their weH-aequainted friend3

And every one doth eall me by my name.

Some tender money tome, some invite me3
Some other give me thanks for kindnesses3
Some offer me commodities to buyz

Ey’n now a tailor called me in his shop,

And ehowed me silke that he had bought forme,
And, 'therewithah took measure of my body.

Sure, vthese are but i11⁸1aginary wileS,

And Lapland sorcerere inhabit here.
“ Shaks'peare.
