etha §optantio §hilline

HAPPY the man, who, void of eares and atrise,
In silken or in leathern purae retains

A splendid shilling. He' nor hears with pain
N ew oysters oried, nor sighs for eheerful ale:
But with his friends, when nightly mista ariae,
To J uniper’s Magpie, or Town Hall, repairs3
Where, mindful of the nymph whose wauton eye
Transfixed his soul, and kindled amorous fiameS,
Chloe or Phillis, he, each circling glasa

Wishes her health‚ and joy, and equal love.
Meanwhile he smokeS, and latighs at inerry tale,
Or pun ambiguouS, or eonundrum quaint. Ι
But I, whom griping penury surrounda

And hunger, sure attendant upon want,

With scanty offalS, and small aeid tiff,
(Wretehed repast l) my meagre eorse sustain:
Then solitary walk, or doze at home

In garret vile, and with a warming puff

Regale ohilled fingers; or thom tube as blank
Aa winter chimney, or well polished jet,

Exhale mundungus‚ ill-perluming aeent.
