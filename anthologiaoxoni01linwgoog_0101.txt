ww last than.

ALL worldly shapes shall melt in gloom,
The Sun himself must die,

Before this mortal shall assume
Its immortality.

I saw a vision in my sleep,

That gave my spirit strength to sweep
Adown the gulf of Time3

I saw the last of human mould‚

That shall Orestion's death behold,

As Adam saw her prime.

The Sun’s eye had a siekly glare,
The earth with age was wan,
The skeletons of nations were
Around that lonely man:
Some had expired in fight, - the brands
Still rusted in their bony hands3

In plague and famine some.

Earth’s sities had no sound nor tread3
And ships ‚were drifting with the dead

To shores where all was dumb.
