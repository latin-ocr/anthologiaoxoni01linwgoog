56 ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

Thus while my joyless minutos tedious flow,
With looks demure, 'and silent pace, a Dan,
Horrible monster! hcted by Gods and men,

To my aerim citadel ascende.

With vocal heel, thrice thundering at my gate,
With hideous secent thrice he calh3 Ι know
The voice ill-boding, and the solemn sound.
What should I do ?‘ or whither turn? Amazed,
Confounded, to the dark recess I fly

Of wood-hole: straight my bristling hairs erect
Through sudden feer3 a chilly sweat bedews
My shuddering limbs, and (wonderful to tell l)
My tongue forgets her faculty of speech3

So horrible he seems! His faded brow
Entrenched with many a frown, and conic heard,
And spreading band, adnrired by modern saints,
Disastrous acts forbode: in his right hand

Long scrolls of paper solemnly he wavos, ,
With characters and figures dire inscribed,
Grievous to mortal eyes3 (yc Gods, avert

Such pingues from righteous men l) Behind him stalks
Another monster not unlike himself,

Sullen of aspect, by the vulgar cederi

A Catchpolc, whose polluted hands the Gods ,
With force incredible, and magic charms

Erst have endued: If he his ample palm

Should haply on ill-futed shoulder lay

Of debtor‚ straight his body, to the touch
Obsequious, (as whilome knights were wont,)
