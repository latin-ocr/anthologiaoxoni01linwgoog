ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

Ι.

OEhe {Qash

COME, take thy harp —’t is vain to muse
Upon the gathering ills we see:
Oh! take thy harp and let me lose ’

All thoughts of ill in hearing thee.

Sing to me, love 1- though death were near,
Thy song could make my soul forget -

N ay, nay, in pity dry that tear,
All may be well, be happy yet.

Let me but see that snowy arm
Once more upon the dear harp lie}
And I will eease to dream of harm,
Will smile at fate, while thou art by.
