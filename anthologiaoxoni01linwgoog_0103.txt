Yet, prophet-like, the lone one stood,
With dauntless words and high,

That shook the sear leaves from the nond,¹

As if a stonn passed by3

Sayin'g‚ “We are twins in death, proud Sun,

Thy face is eold, thy raee is run,
’T is. Merey bids thee g03
For thou ten thousand thousand years

That shall n0 longer {loia¹

That gave its heavenly spark3
Yet think not, Sun, it shall be dim
When thou thyself art dark.

Nol it shall live again, and shine

In bliss nnknown to beams of thine3
By. Him recalled to breath, ¹
Who captive led eaptivity,
Who robbed the grave of victory,
And'took the sting from Death.
