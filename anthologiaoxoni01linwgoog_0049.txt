18 ANTHOLOGIA Oxomrtnsrs.

While e’on thy ohill, hloak oorse I hare,
Thou seemest still mine own3
But there Ι lay thee in thy grave,—

And Ι am now alone!

I do not think, where’er thou art,
Thou host forgotten me3

And I, perhaps, may soothe this hoart
In thinking, too, of thee:

Yet, there was round theo suoh a down
Of light ne’er seen before,

As fancy never could have drawn,

And never can restore.

WHnN born, in teors we saw thee drowned,

Whilst thy assemblod friends around

With smiles their joy confest:
So live that in thy latest hour l

We may the floods of sorrow pour,
And thou in smiles be drest.
