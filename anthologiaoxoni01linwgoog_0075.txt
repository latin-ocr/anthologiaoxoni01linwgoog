XXV.

llo helia.

DfflNK to me only with thine eyes, ,
And Ι will pledge with mine3

Or leave a kiss but in the oup,
And I’ll not look for wine.

The thirst that from the soul doth riso
Doth ask a drink divine3 ’

But, might I of J ove’s neotar' sip,
I would not change for thine.

I sent thee late a rosy wreath,
Not so muoh honouring thee, ’
As giving it a hope, that there
It might not withered he:
But thou thereon didst only breathe,
And sent'st it back to me;

Since when it groWS‚ and emellssl owenh,

Not of ilself‚ but thee.

Ben Jonson. ἵ
