THERE ’s abower of reses by Beudemeer’s stream,
And the uightingule sings round it all the day long3

Iu the time of my ehildhood ’tuas like a sweet dream,
To sit in the reses end hear the bird’s song.

That bower and its music I never surget,

But oft when alone, in the bloom of the year,
I‚think-is the uightingale singing there yet?

Are the roses still bright by the calm Bendemeer?

No, the roses soon withered that hung 0’er the wave,
But some blossoms were guthered‚ while freshly they
shone,
, Anda dew was distilled from their flowers‚ that gave
All the fragrance of summer, when summer was

gone.

Thus memory draws from delight‚ ere it dies,

An essenee that breethes of it many a year ;

· Thus bright to my sonl, as ’tuas then to my eyes,

Is that bower on the banks of the calm Bendemeer.
