WHO is this that cometh srom Edom‚ with (lyed gar-
ments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel,
travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that spealr
in righteousness‚ mighty to save.

Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy
garments like him that treadeth in thewinefat?

Ι have trodden the wine-prese alone3 and os the
people there was none with me: for Ι will tread them
in mine anger, and trample them in my fury3 and their
blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will
stain all my raiment.

For the day of vengeanoe is in my heart, ond the year
of my redeemed is oome.

And Ι looked, and there was none to help3 and I
wondered that there was none¹ to uphold: therefore
mine own arm brought salvation unto me 3 and my fury,

it upheld me.
And Ι will trearl down the people in mine anger, and

make them drunk in my fury, and Iwill bring down
their strength to the earth.
