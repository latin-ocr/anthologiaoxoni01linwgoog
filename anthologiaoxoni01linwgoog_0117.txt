ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

XLIX. .

ωδε muling omnim.

YOU gave me last week a young linnet
shut up in a fine golden cage;
Yet how sad the poor thing was within it!

Oh Ξ how it did flutter and rage 1
Then he moped and he pined

That his wings were confined,
Till Ι opened the door of his den:
Then, so merry was he1

And, because he was free,

He came to his oage b'aok again. ⁶
