——-—-——.-—

Anns! they had been friends in youth3

But whispering tongues can poison truth;
And constancy dwells in realms above3
And life is thnrny 3 and youth is vain 3 “
And to be wroth with one we love
Doth work like madness in the hrain.
&Eaeh spake words of high disdain
, And insult to his heart’s best brother3
They parted— ne’er to meet again!
But never either found another
To free the hollow heart from paining ; —
They stood aloof, the snare remaining,
Like cliffs which had been rent asunder3
A dreary sea now flows between ;-
But neither heat, nor host, nor thunder,
Shall wholly do away, I ween‚

The'marks of that which once hath been.
Coleridge.
