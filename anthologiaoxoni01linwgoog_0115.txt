ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

XLVIII.

Eleas ou thr daath ot aa unfortunate {aaa

ΒΥ foreign hands thy dying eyes were closed,

By foreign hands thy decent limbo composed3

By foreign hands thy humble grave adorned,

By strangers honoured, and by strangers mournedl
What though no friends in sablo woeds appear,

Grieve for an hour, perhaps, then mourn a year,

And bear about the mookery of woe

To midnight danaes and the publio show?

What though no weeping Loves thy ashes graoe,
Nor polished marble emulate thy face?

What though no sacred earth allow thee room,
Nor hallowed dirge be muttered o’er thy tomb?
Yot shall thy grave with rising flowers be dressed,
And the green turf lie lightly on thy breaat:
There shall the morn her earhest tears bestow,
There the first rosea of the year shall blow3
While angels with their silver wings o'ershade

The ground, now sacred by thy relies made.

Pope.
