Eleon ta a drumm nantuato.

ΤΗΕ ourfew tolls the knell of parting day,
The lowing herd winda slowly o'er the lea,
The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,
And leaves the world to darkness and to me.

Now fades the glimmering landseape 011 the sight,
And all the aira solemn stillness holds,

Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,
And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:

Ἴ Save that, from yonder ivy-mantled tower,

The moping owl‘does to the moon complain
Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,

Molest her ancient solitary reign.

Hark! how the sacred oalm that breathes around
Bids every fioroo tumultuous passion cesse,
In still small aecents whispering from the ground

A grateful earnest'of eternal peace.
oray.
