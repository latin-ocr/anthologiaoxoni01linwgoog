ΒΥ the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yos,
we wept, when we remembered Zion.

We hanged our harpe upon the willows in the midst
thereos.

For there they that oarried us away captive required
of us a soug3 and they that wasted us required of us

‘ mirth, saying‚ Singos one of the songs of Zion.

How shall we sing the LORD’s song in a strange
land?

If I forget thee, Ο Jerusalem, let my right hand

forget her cunning.

If Ι do not remember thee, let my tougue cleave to

the roof of my mouth3 if Ι prefer not Jerusalem above

my ohief joy.
