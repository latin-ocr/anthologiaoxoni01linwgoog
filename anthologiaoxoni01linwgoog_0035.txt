WHEN the British warrior-queen,
Bleeding from the Roman rods,

Sought, with an indignant mien,
Counsel of her country’s gods ;

Sage beneath the spreading oak

Sat the Druid, hoa1y chief 3⁴
Every burning word he spoke

Full of rage, and full of grief.

“ Prinoessl if our aged eyes

Weep upon thy matohless wronga
Tis because resentinent ties

All the terrore of our tongues.

‘⁶ Rome shall perish — write that word

ln the blood that she hasspilt3
Perish, hopeless and abhorred,

Deep in ruins as in guilt.
