Gnrunrr ye rose-hudo while ye may„
Old Time is still a·flying;

And this same flower that smiles to-day,
To-morrow will be dying.

The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,

¹ The higher he's a·getting;

The sooner will his raoe be run,

, The nearer he's to setting.

That age is best, which is the first,
When youth and blood are warmer3

But being spent, the worse and worst

Times still suooeed the former.

Then be not ooy3 but use your time,
And while ye may, go marry3
For having lost but onoe your prime,

You may for ever tany.

R.Herrr'ck.
