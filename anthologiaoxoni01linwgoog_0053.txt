WHY will Florella, when Ι gaze,

My ravished eyes reprove3
And hide from them the only fane
They ean behold with love? Ι

To shun her seorn, and eaae my aare,
I seek a nymph more kind 3
And, while I rove from fair to fair,

Still gentler usage find.

But oh! how faint is every joy,
Where nature has no part!
N ew beauties may my eyes employ,

But you engage my heart.

So restless exiles, doomed to roam,

Meet pity everywhere3 ’

¹Yet languish for their native· home,
Though death attende them there!
