fifth, xxxix.

HAST thou given the horse strength? hast thou elothed
his neck with thunder?

Canst thou make him afraid ae a grashopper? the
glory of his nostrils is terrible.

He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth inhis strength:

he goeth on te meet the armed men.

He moeketh at fear, and is not affrighted3 neither
turneth he back from the swerd„

The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering apear
and the shield.

He swalleweth the ground' with fiereeness and tage:
neither believeth he that itis the sound of the tnumss

pet.
He saith among the trumpeta Ha, ha3 and he

smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains,
and the shouting.‘
