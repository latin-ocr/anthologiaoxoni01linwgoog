XXIII.
§aaa

COME away, earne away, death,
· And in sad cypress let me be laid3
Fly away, fly away, breath ;
³ Ι am alain by a fair eruel maid.
· My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
Ο, prepare it3
My part of death, no one so true
Did share it.

Not a flower, ¹not a flower eweet‚
On my blank eoffin let there he strown;
N ot a friend, not a friend greet
, My poor corpse, where my hones shall be thrown:
Ξ A thousand thousand eigha ta save,
Lay rne, O, where
Sad true lover never find rny grave,
To weep there.

XXIV.

naratha.

Lm nn —while rny revenge shall be

Το speak the very trnth of thee.
