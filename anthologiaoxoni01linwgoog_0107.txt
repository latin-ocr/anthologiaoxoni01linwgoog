xm.

I rann the clouds, the rainbcw, and the flowers

With thcir ethereal cclcurs; the mocn’s globe

And thc purc stars in their eternal bcwers

Are cinctured with my power, aa with a robe3
Whatevcr lamps cn earth and heaven may shir
Arc portione cf one power, which is mine.

I stand at n00n upon the peak of heaven,

Then with unwilling steps I wander down

Into the clouds cf the Atlantia even;

For grief that I depart they weep and frown:
What look ia more delightful than the smile

With which Ι scothe them from the western i
enen

TELL me, where is fancy bred,
Or in the heart, cr in the head?
How begct, hcw ncurished?

It is cngendercd in the eyeS,
With gazing fed; and fancy (lies
In the cradle where it lies:
Lct us all ring fancy's knell;
I’ll begin it‚-Ding‚ dcng, bell.
Ding, dcng, bell.
