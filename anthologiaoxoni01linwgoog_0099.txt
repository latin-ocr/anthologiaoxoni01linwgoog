'TIS sung in anoIent minstrelsy
That Phoebus wont to wear

The leaves of any pleasant tree
Around his golden hair,

·Till Daphne, desperate with pursuit

Of his imperious love,
At her own prayer transfonned, took root
A laurel in the grove.

Then did the Penitent adorn
His brow with laurel green3

And ’mid his bright looks never ahorn
No meaner leaf was seen3

‘And poete sage, in every age,
About their temples wound

The bay3 and conquerors thanked the gods
With laurel ehaplets orowned.

Into the mists of fabling time
So far runs books the praiee

Of beauty, which disdains to olimb
Along forbidden ways3

That scorns temptation, power defleo,
Where mutual love is not3

And to the tomb for resoue flies
When life would be a blot.
