82 ANTHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

XLVI.

ΙΤ was the spring, and newly risen day

Peeped o’e'r the hamlets on the first of May3

My eyeS, too tender for tho blaze of light,

Still sought the sheltor of retiring night,

When Love approaohed in painted plumes arrayed,
The insidioue god bis rattling darts betrayed, ,
Nor less his infant features, and the sly ,

Sweet intimatione of his threatening eye.

Such the Sigeon boy is seen above

Filling the ‘goblet for imperial Jove;

Such he 011 whom the Nympha bestowed their charmi
Hylae, who perishod in a N aiad’s arms:

Angry he seemed‚ yet graoeful in his ire,

And added threata not destitute of fire.

ΜΠ. ,
dia a female euphrata.

Corin, Leila, fill the goblet up,

Roaoh round the rosy wine:
Ἴ Think not that we will take the oup

From any band but thine.

A draught like this ’t were vain to seek3
No grape ean such supply3

It steals its tints from Leila's obeok, ·
Its brightness from her eye.
