XXVIII.

Bnnlnvn me, if all those endearing young oharms
Which Ι gaze on eo fondly t0·day,

Were to change by to-morrow, and fleet in my orme,
Like fairy gifts fading away 3

Thou wouldet still be adored, as this moment thou art,
Let thy lovelinesefade as it will;

And around the dear'louin eaoh wish of my heart

would entwine nselfverdanoy stin.

It is not while beauty and >youth are thino οινῐι,Ι
And thy oheeks unprofaned by a tear,

That the fervour andsaith of a heart ean be known,
To which time will-but make thee more dear.

Oh! the heart thet has truly loved never forgets,

But as truly loves on to the close! Ἴ ,

As the sun-flower turne on her god, when he sete,

The same look whioh ¹ohe turned when he rose.
, none.
