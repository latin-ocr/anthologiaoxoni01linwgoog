FAIR Isobel, poor simple leobell

Lorenzo‚ a young palmer in Love’s eyel
They could not in the oelfsame mansion dwell
without some stir of henrt, some maludy 3
They oould not sit at rneals but feel how well
It soothiid each to bo the other by 3
They could not, sure, beneath the sume roof sleep‚
But to eaoh other dream and nightly weep.

With every morn their love grew tenderer‚
With every eve deeper and tenderer still3
He might not in house, field, or ginden, stir,
But her full shape would all his seeing fill3
And his continual voice was pleasanter
To her, than noise of trees or hidden rill,
Her lrrte-string gave an eoho of his name,
She spoilt her half-done broidery with the sume.

He knew whose gentle hand was at the lotch, ’
Before the door had given her to his eyes3

And from her chamber window he would catch
Her beauty farther than the falcon spies3

And constant au her vespere would he walch,
Because her fauo was turned lo the same skies3

And with siok longing all the night outwear,

To hear her morning step upon the stoir.
