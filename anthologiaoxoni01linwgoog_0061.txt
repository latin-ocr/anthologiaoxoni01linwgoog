huto.

SHn dwelt among the untrodden waye
Beside the springs of Dove 3
A maid whom there were none to praise,

And very few to love.

A violet by a mossy stone
Half-hidden from the eye3

Fair as a star when only one

Is shining in the sky.

She lived unknown, ond few oould know
When Luoy eeaned to be;

And she is in her grave, end oh!
The differenee ιο me!

ΕΛΚΕ, τάλαν, παρὰ μητρὸς ὃν οὐκ ἔτι μαζὸν ἀμέλξεις
ἕλκυσον, ὑστάτιον νᾶμιι καταφθιμλνηι.
ἤδη «γὰρ ξιφέεσσι λιπόπνοοι, ἀλλὰ τὰ μητρὸς1

φίλτρα καὶ εἰν Ἀΐδῃ παιδοκομεῖν ἔμαθον.
