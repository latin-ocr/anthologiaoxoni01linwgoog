6 ARTHOLOGIA oxomnn'sls.

“ Rome, for empire far renowned,
Tramples on a thousand states3
Soon her pride shall kiss the ground —
Harkl the Gaul is at her gates!

“ Other Romans shall orise,
Heedless of a soldier's name3
Sounds, not arms, shall wln the prize,

Harmony the path to fame.

“ Thon the progeny that springs
From the forests of our land,
Armed with thunder, olad with wings‚

shall a wider ssorld command.

‘⁶ Regions Caesar novor knew
Thy posterity shall sway 3

ll‘here his engles never flew,

None invinoible as they.”

Such the bard’s prophetie words,
Pregnant with celestial fire,
Bending as he swspt the ohords
Of his swoet but awful lyre.
