dha detrun.

Βοιὼ on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll.
Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain,
Man marks the earth with ruin3 his oontrol
Stops with the shore3 upon the watery plain
The wreoks are all thy deed3 nor doth remain
A shadow of man’s ravage, save his own,
When, for a moment, like a drop of rain,

He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan,

Without a grave, unknelled, unooffined, and unknown.

Byron.

XXXIV.

who laniabam.

’ MY beart leaps up when Ι behold
A rainbow in the skyl
So was it, when my life began 3
So is it now Ι am a man3
So let it be, when I grow old,
Or let me die.
The child is father of the man,

And I would wish my days to be

Bound each to each by natural piety.
