ΤΗΕΥ bid me sleop, thoy bid me pray,
They say my brain is warped ond wrung3-
I cannot sleep on Highland brae,

I oonnot pray in Highland tonguo.
But were I now where Allan glides‚

Or heard my native Devan’s tideo,

So sweetly would I rest, and pray
That Heaven would close my wintry day!

’Τ was thus my hair they bade mo braid,

They bade me to the ohuroh repair3
It was my bridal morn, they said,

And my true-love would meet mo there:
But woe betide tho oruel guile . ·
That drowned in blood the morning smilel
And woe betido the fairy droam!

I only waked to sob and ocream.
