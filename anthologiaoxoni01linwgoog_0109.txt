XLIII.

(Ine Inna.

ΤΗΕ rose had been washed, just washed in a shower‚
Which Mary to Anna conveyed3

The plentiful moisture enoumbored the fiower,
And weighed down its beautiful head.

The cup was all filled, and the leaves were all wet3
And it seemed to a fanoiful view,

To woop for the buds it had left with regret
On the flourishing bush where it grew.

I hastily seized it, unfit as it was

For a nosegay, so dripping and drowned3
And swinging it rudely, too rudely, alas!

I snapped it, it fell to the ground.

“ And suoh‚'’ Ι exolaimed “ is the pitiless part
Some aot by the delicate mind, „
Regardless of wringing and breaking a heart
Already to sorrow resigned.

“ This elegant rose, had I shaken it less,
Might have bloomed with its owner awhile;

And the tear, that is wiped with a little address,
May be followed perhaps by a smile.’'

Cowper.
