As bees

In spring-time, when the Sun with Taurus rideo,
Pour forth their populous youth about the hive

In clustersz they among fresh dews and flowers
Fly to and fro, or on the smoothiid plnnk,

ξ The suburb of their straw-built eitedeh
New-rubbed with baim, expatiate and oonfer

ἶ Their state affairs, So thick the aery crowd

Swarmed and were straightened3 till, the signal give
Behold a wonder! They, but now who seemed
In bigness to surpass Eurth’s giant sons,

Now less than smallest dwarfe, in narrow room
Throng numberlesS‚ like that Pygmean rnoe
>Beyond the Indian mount3 or faery elves,

Whose midnight revels, by a forest side

Or fountain, some belated pensant seeo,

Or dreams he sees, while overheed the Moon

sits arbitrere, and nearer to the earth

Wheeis her pale oourse3 they, on their mirth and dan
Intent, with joound musio oharm his ear3

At onoe with joy and fear his heart reboundo
Moron.
