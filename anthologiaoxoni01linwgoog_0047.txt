AN'IHOLOGIA OXONIENSIS.

VIII.

Ν ou toleto

In I had thought thou oouldst hove died,
I might not weep for thee3

But I forgot, when at thy eide, ·
Thot thou oouldst mortal he:

It never through my mind hod passed,
The time would e’er be o’er‚

And Ι 011 thee should look my lost,

. And thou shouldst emile no more.

And still upon that saoe I look,
And think 't will emile again 3

And still the thought I will not brook, ,
That I must look in voini .

But, when I spealn-thou dost not say,
What thou ne’er left’st unsaid3

And now Ι feel, as well I may,
Sweet Many! thou art dead!

If thou wouldst stay, e’en as thou art,

All oold and all serene,-

I still might prees thy silent heort,

And where thy smiles have been!
